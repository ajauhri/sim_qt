Simulations should include:
    . assumptions
        .. ⋋ < µ for stability

    . open system
        .. multiple/random number of requests send to a server
        .. server does some work on each process

    . closed system
        .. concretely model requests and responses
        .. 

    . scheduling policies
        .. shortest job first (sjf)
        .. shortest remaining processing time (srpt)
        .. first scheduled first served (fsfs)
        .. round robin 
        .. random

    . parameters to base comparisions upon
        .. response time
        .. turnaround time
        .. time in system
        .. flow time
        .. waiting time
        .. number of jobs in queue
